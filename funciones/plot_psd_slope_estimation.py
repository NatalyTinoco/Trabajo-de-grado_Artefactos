===================================================================
Estimation of the slope and intercept of the Power Spectral Density
===================================================================

This example aims at showing how the utility function `power_spectrum` and 
the feature function :func:`mne_features.univariate.compute_spect_slope` can 
be used to estimate the slope and the intercept of the Power Spectral 
Density (PSD, computed using the FFT of the signal).

The code for this example is based on the method proposed in:

Jean-Baptiste SCHIRATTI, Jean-Eudes LE DOUGET, Michel LE VAN QUYEN,
Slim ESSID, Alexandre GRAMFORT,
"An ensemble learning approach to detect epileptic seizures from long
intracranial EEG recordings"
Proc. IEEE ICASSP Conf. 2018

.. note::

    This example is for illustration purposes, as other methods
    may lead to more robust/reliable estimation of the slope and intercept 
    of the PSD.
